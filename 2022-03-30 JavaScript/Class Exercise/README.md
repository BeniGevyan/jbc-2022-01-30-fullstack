# Class Exercise

## Create JavaScript for the following tasks:

1. Create a function that gets a first name and last name from the user, and displays his full name.  
   Invoke this function twice.

2. Create a function that gets three numbers as arguments, and displays their sum and average.  
   Invoke this function three times:

- first call - with "Hard-Coded" arguments.
- second call - with random numbers.
- third call - with numbers you get from the user.

3. Get a number `n` from the user.  
   Display a square of Asterix (`*`) with the size of `n` X `n`.  
   Use functions in your script:

- A function that gets a number `len` as an argument, and displays `len` Asterix (`*`) in a row.
- A function that gets a number `size` as an argument, and displays the square by invoking the first function.  
  In the main script, get the number from the user and invoke the second function.

4. Get one number from the user.  
   Display a triangle by this number, for example, the number is `4` - display:

```
1
12
123
1234
```

Use functions in your script:

- A function that gets a number `limit` as an argument, and displays all numbers between `1` and `limit` in a row.
- A function that gets a number `size` as an argument, and displays the triangle by invoking the first function.  
  In the main script, get the number from the user and invoke the second function.

5. Get a number `n` from the user.  
   Display `n` random-sized rectangles of Asterix (`*`).  
   Use functions in your script:

- A function that gets a number `len` as an argument, and displays `len` Asterix (`*`) in a row.
- A function that gets two numbers `width` and `height` as arguments, and displays a rectangle by invoking the first function.
- A function that gets one number `count` as an argument, and displays `count` rectangles by invoking the second function
  In the main script, get the number from the user and invoke the third function.
