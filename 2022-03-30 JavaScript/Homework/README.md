# Homework

## Create JavaScript for the following tasks:

1. Create a function that displays `Make Things Go Right` and breaks a line (using `<br/>`).  
   Invoke this function three times.

2. Create a function that displays your full name.  
   Invoke this function 100 times.

3. Create a function that gets one string as an argument, and displays that string 10 times.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing a "Hard-Coded" string.  
   Invoke this function by one time passing a string you get from the user.

4. Create a function that gets one string and one number as arguments, and displays the string `number` times.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing "Hard-Coded" arguments.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing arguments you get from the user.

5. Create a function that gets three numbers as arguments, and displays their average.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing "Hard-Coded" arguments.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing arguments you get from the user.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing random arguments.

6. Create a function that gets three numbers as arguments, and displays the maximum number.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing "Hard-Coded" arguments.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing arguments you get from the user.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing random arguments.

7. Create a function that displays a smiley by a number it gets as an argument.  
    for `1`, display `üòÄ`  
    for `2`, display `üôÅ`  
    for `3`, display `üòè`  
    for `4`, display `üòâ`  
    for `5`, display `üòé`  
   Invoke this function one time by passing a "Hard-Coded" number as an argument.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing a number you get from the user as an argument.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing a random integer number between `1` and `5` you get from the user as an argument.  
   Create a function that displays all 5 smilies by invoking the first function.  
   Create a function that displays 100 random smilies by invoking the first function.

8. Create a function that displays the time (tip: use Google).  
   This function should not get any arguments.  
   Invoke this function once.

9. Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument, and displays the array.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing a "Hard-Coded" array as an argument.  
   Invoke this function one time by passing a random array as an argument.

10. Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument, and displays the average number in the array.  
    Invoke this function one time by passing a "Hard-Coded" array as an argument.  
    Invoke this function one time by passing a random array as an argument.

11. Create a function that gets two numbers as arguments `start` and `end`.  
    The function should display a random number between `start` and `end` (inclusive).  
     Invoke this function one time by passing "Hard-Coded" numbers as arguments.  
     Invoke this function one time by passing numbers you get from the user as arguments.  
     Invoke this function 100 times by passing `-10` and `10` as arguments.

12. Get an integer number `n` from the user.  
    Display a square of Asterix (`*`) with the size of `n` X `n`.  
    Break your script into appropriate functions.

13. Get two integer numbers from the user, `width` and `height`.  
    Display a rectangle of Asterix (`*`) with `width` and `height` as dimensions.  
    Break your script into appropriate functions.  
    Invoke the main function one time by passing "Hard-Coded" integer numbers as arguments.  
    Invoke the main function one time by passing random integer numbers as arguments.
    Invoke the main function one time by passing integer numbers you get from the user as arguments.

14. Create a function that gets an integer number `count` as an argument.  
    The function should display `count` rectangles with random dimensions.  
    Use the function from the previous task (13.).

15. Get two integer numbers from the user, `width` and `height`.  
    Display an empty rectangle of Asterix (`*`) with `width` and `height` as dimensions.  
    For example, `width` is `6` and `height` is `4`, display:

    ```
    ******
    *    *
    *    *
    ******
    ```

    Invoke the main function one time by passing "Hard-Coded" integer numbers as arguments.  
    Invoke the main function one time by passing random integer numbers as arguments.
    Invoke the main function one time by passing integer numbers you get from the user as arguments.

16. Create a function that gets an integer number `n` as an argument.  
    The function should display all numbers between `n` and `1` in descending order.  
    For example, `n` is `5`, display:

```
54321
```

Create another function that gets an integer number `n` as an argument.  
 The function should display a rectangle of numbers with `n` as a base.  
 For example, `n` is `5`, display:

```
54321
4321
321
21
1
```

17. Create a function that gets an integer number `n` as an argument.  
    The function should display a rectangle of Asterix (`*`) with `n` as a base.  
    For example, `n` is `5`, display:

```
*****
****
***
**
*
```

18. Create a function that gets an integer number `n` as an argument.  
    The function should display a rectangle of numbers and Asterix (`*`) by `n`.  
    For example, `n` is `4`, display:

```
1234****
123***
12**
1*
```

Break your script into appropriate functions.

19. Create a function that gets an integer number `n` as an argument.  
    The function should display two rectangles of Asterix (`*`) with `n` as a base.  
    For example, `n` is `4`, display:

```
****
***
**
*
*
**
***
****
```

Break your script into appropriate functions.

20. **challenge** - Create a function that gets an integer number `n` as an argument.  
    The function should display a symmetric rectangle of numbers by `n`.  
    For example, `n` is `4`, display:

```
   1
  212
 12321
1234321
```

Break your script into appropriate functions.
