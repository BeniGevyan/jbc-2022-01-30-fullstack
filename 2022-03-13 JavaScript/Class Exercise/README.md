# Class Exercise

## Create JavaScript for the following tasks:

1. Create an array.  
   Fill the array with 100 random integer numbers from `0` (included) to `100` (not included).  
   Display all numbers.  
   Display the lowest number.

2. What will be the output of the following script:  
   \*Calculate manually, then run to test your answer.

```js
var a = 1;
var b = 1;

a += 12;
b = ++a;
a *= 2;
b += 8;
b--;
a *= 3;
b = --a;
a %= 2;
b = --a;

document.write(`a = ${a}, b = ${b}`);
```

3. Here is a Matrix:

```js
var prices = [
  [100, 200, 150, 300],
  [20, 50, 34],
  [99, 33, 22, 66, 33, 22, 22, 66],
];
```

- Display the Matrix in 2 dimensional way.
- Display what is the average price.
