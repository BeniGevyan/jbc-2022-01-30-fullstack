# Homework

1. Create a `Set` collection of emails.  
   Insert into this Set 5 different emails (Hard-coded).  
   Try to insert 2 more emails that already exist in the Set.  
   Display the Set size.  
   Display the Set items using `for-of`.  
   Display an alert saying whether `moishe@gmail.com` exists in the Set or not.

2. Create a `Set` collection of users.  
   Get 5 emails from the user and insert them into the set.  
   Display the Set size.  
   Display the Set items using `for-of`.

3. Create a `Map` collection of products.  
   Insert into this Map 5 products where the key is the product code (number) and the value is the product name (string) (Hard-coded).  
   Display the Map keys using `for-of`.  
   Display the Map values using `for-of`.  
   Display the Map keys and values using `for-of`.  
   Display an alert saying whether a product with the code `7` exists on the Map or not.  
   Display the product name for the product that has the code `3` (assuming the product exists on the Map).

4. Create a `Map` collection of cars.  
   Each car is an object with year, manufacturer, model, and color properties.  
   Insert into this Map 5 cars where the key is the number plate (string) and the value is the car (object) (Hard-coded).  
   Display an alert saying whether a car with the number plate `"1005070"` exists on the Map or not.  
   Display the car that has the number plate `"0020595"` (assuming the car exists on the Map).

5. Create an array and fill it with 20 random integer numbers between `1` and `100`.  
   Using array function like `forEach`, `find`, `map`, `reduce` etc. Display:

- The array (each item in a separate line).
- The first even number.
- The first number that is greater than `50`.
- All odd numbers.
- All numbers that are greater than `50`.
- The **index** of the first number that is greater than `50`.
- For each number display wheater it is an even or odd number.
- The minimum number.
- The maximum number.

6. Create an empty array.  
   Using a loop, fill the array with 20 objects where each object describes a point on the coordinates with `x` and `y` properties.  
   The `x` and `y` random numbers between `0` and `100` (inclusive).  
   Using array function like `forEach`, `find`, `map`, `reduce` etc. Display:

- The array (each `x`, `y` pair in a separate line).
- The first point where `x` is greater than `y`.
- The first point where `y` is greater than `50`.
- All points where `x` is an odd number.
- All points where `y` is greater than `50`.
- The **index** of the first point where `x` is greater than `50`.
- For each point - the distance from the origin of the coordinates (0, 0).
- The minimum `x`.
- The point with the minimum `x`.

7. Create an empty array.  
   Using a loop, fill the array with 20 objects where each object describes a pizza.  
   Each pizza object has a diameter (cm), number of slices, number of toppings, and price properties.  
   Each property is a random number that has to make sense (for example, 50 toppings don't make sense).  
   Using array function like `forEach`, `find`, `map`, `reduce` etc. Display:

- The array (each pizza in a separate line).
- The first pizza without toppings.
- The first pizza that is cheaper than `30`.
- All small pizzas - diameter is less than or equal to `20`.
- All the expensive pizzas - price is more than `80`.
- All "Normal" pizzas - pizzas without toppings.
- The index of the first pizza with `6` slices.
- The radius of each pizza (radius = diameter/2).
- For each pizza a new object with price (the original price) and vat (the original price includes the vat already).
- The sum of all pizzas price.
- The maximum price.
- The most expensive pizza.
