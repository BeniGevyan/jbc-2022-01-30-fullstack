# Class Exercise

## Create Flow Charts for the following:

## For Loop

1. Using For loop, display 50 smileys `(-:`.

2. Using For loop, display all even numbers between `2` to `500`.

3. Get ten numbers from the user.  
For each number that was entered, display its power of 2.  

4. Get two numbers from the user - `first` and `last`.  
Display all numbers between `first` and `last` in ascending order.  
You can assume `first` is lower than `last`.

5. Get two numbers from the user - `first` and `last`.  
Display all numbers between `first` and `last` in ascending order.  
It is unknown which number is lower.

6. Get ten numbers from the user.  
For each number that was entered, display all numbers between `1` and `number`.  
You can assume all numbers are positive integers.

7. Get `width` and `height` from the user.  
Display a rectangle of Asterix (`*`) with these dimensions.  
For example: `width` is `8` and `height` is `5`, display:  
```
********
********
********
********
********
```  

8. Get one number from the user.  
Display a triangle of Asterix (`*`) with ascending order `1` to `number`.  
For example, the number is `4`, display:  
```
*
**
***
****
```  

9. Get one number from the user.  
Display in one line all numbers between `1` and `number` in ascending order,  
then in a new line all numbers between `number` and `1` in descending order.  
You can assume the number is a positive integer.  

10. Get one number from the user.  
Display a square full of numbers with a width of `number` and  a height of `number` like the following:
For example, number is `4`, display: 
```
4321
4321
4321
4321
``` 

## Break

11. Get 100 numbers from the user.  
For each number that the user enters, display its power of 2.  
But, `666` or `13` are "bad luck" numbers, so if they are entered, break the loop immediately.
