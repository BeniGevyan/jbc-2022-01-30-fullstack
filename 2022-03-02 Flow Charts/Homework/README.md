## Create Flow Charts for the following:

1. Get two numbers from the user, display the lower one.  

2. Get one number from the user.  
Display a message that says if the number ends with `5` or not.  

3. Get a number from the user again and again until `0` is entered.  
For each number, display if the number is positive or negative.  
For `0`, do not display anything and break the loop immediately.

4. Get a number from the user again and again until `0` is entered.  
For each number, display its power of 3.  
For `0`, do not display anything and break the loop immediately.

5. Get a number from the user again and again until a number that can be divided by `7` without a remainder is entered.    
For each number, display if the number is positive, negative, or `0`.   
For a number that can be divided by `7` without a remainder, do not display anything and break the loop immediately.  

6. Get a number from the user again and again until `0` is entered.  
For each number, **include** `0`, display if the number is positive, negative, or `0`.

7. Get a number from the user again and again until `0` is entered.  
For each number, **include** `0`, display its power of 3.

8. Get a number from the user again and again until a number that can be divided by `7` without a remainder is entered.    
For each number, **include** `7`, display if the number is positive, negative, or `0`.  

9. Display all numbers between `1` and `300` (inclusive).  

10. Display all numbers between `-300` and `300` (inclusive).

11. Get one number from the user.  
Display all numbers between `1` and `number` (inclusive).

12. Get one number from the user.  
Display all numbers between `number` and `1` in descending order (inclusive).

13. Get one number from the user.  
Display all numbers between `1` and `number` in ascending order (inclusive),  
Then, all numbers between `number` and `1` in descending order (inclusive).

14. Get two numbers from the user (assume the first one is lower).  
Display all numbers between them in ascending order (inclusive).

15. Get two numbers from the user (it is unknown which one is lower).  
Display all numbers between them in ascending order (inclusive).

16. Get two numbers from the user (it is unknown which one is lower).  
Display all numbers between them that end with `7` or can be divided by `7` without a reminder in ascending order (inclusive).  

17. Get one number from the user.  
Display a square of Asterix (`*`) with a width of `number` and height of `number`.  
For example, the number is `4`, display:  
```
****
****

```

18. Get one number from the user.  
Display a triangle of Asterix (`*`) like the following:  
For example, the number is `5`, display:  
```
*****
****
***
**
*
```  

19. Get one number from the user.  
Display a triangle of numbers like the following:  
For example, the number is `5`, display:  
```
1
12
123
1234
12345
```

20. Get one number from the user.  
Display a square full of numbers with a width of `number` and  a height of `number` like the following:
For example, the number is `5`, display: 
```
54321
54321
54321
54321
```  

21. Get a number from the user again and again until `0` or a negative number is entered.  
Display all numbers between `number` and `1` in descending order (inclusive).
