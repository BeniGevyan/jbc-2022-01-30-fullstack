  Create an interface named `CircularShape` that contains the function `getDiameter` and implement this interface in `Circle`.  
  In `main.ts` create one shape of each class, and display its details, area, and perimeter.  
  Create a variable of the base class type, assign it with a random shape, and display its details, area, and perimeter.  
  If the chosen shape is a circle, display its diameter.
