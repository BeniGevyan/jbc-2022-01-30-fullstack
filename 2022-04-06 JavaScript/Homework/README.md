# Homework

1. Create a function `getMax` that gets two numbers as arguments.  
   The function should return the maximum number.  
   Create a function `testMax`.  
   The function gets two numbers from the user (using "prompt"), invokes `getMax`, and displays the maximum number (using "alert").  
   Create a webpage with a button that when clicked invokes `testMax`.

2. Create a webpage with a button that when clicked invokes a function that gets two numbers from the user `width` and `height`.  
    The function should display an empty Asterix rectangle. Just like we did at task 15 [here](https://github.com/barsheshet/jbc-2022-01-30-fullstack/tree/main/2022-03-30%20JavaScript/Homework#homework).  
   divide your code to appropriate functions.

3. Create a webpage with 4 buttons.

- first button: when clicked, gets two numbers from the user and displays their sum.
- second button: when clicked, gets two numbers from the user and displays their subtraction.
- third button: when clicked, gets two numbers from the user and displays their multiplication.
- forth button: when clicked, gets two numbers from the user and displays their division.
  divide your code to appropriate functions.

4. Create a webpage with a button that when clicked invokes a function that gets two numbers from the user `a` and `b`.  
   The function should display all numbers between `a` and `b` in ascending order (inclusive).  
    divide your code to appropriate functions.

5. Create an annoying webpage with an input that for each character that the user enters, displays an alert with the message `Keep writing!`.
   divide your code to appropriate functions.

6. Create a webpage with a button that when clicked shows the current time (Google it).
   divide your code to appropriate functions.

7. Create a webpage with input to enter text and a button.  
   When the button is clicked, display an alert with text that was entered inside the input.

8. Create a webpage with three inputs to enter numbers and two buttons.  
   When the first button is clicked, Display the sum of the three numbers inside the inputs.  
   When the second button is clicked, Display the average of the three numbers.  
    divide your code to appropriate functions.

9. Create a webpage with an input.  
   On each character the user enters, change the background of the input color randomly between the colors: red, blue, green, and yellow.

10. Create a webpage with input to enter email and a button.  
    When the button is clicked, display the email.  
    If the input is empty, display an error message instead.
    divide your code to appropriate functions.

11. Create a webpage with two inputs to enter first name and last name and a button.  
    When the button is clicked, display the full name (first and last name concatenated).  
    If one of the names is missing, Display an error message and change the background color of the missing name to red.  
    divide your code to appropriate functions.

12. Create a webpage with four buttons.  
    Apply style to the buttons using CSS file: all buttons should have a green background color and white font color.  
    When a button gets hovered with the mouse, you should change its background color to red and font color to blue.  
    When the mouse pointer leaves the button, its background color should return to green and font color to white.  
     divide your code to appropriate functions.
