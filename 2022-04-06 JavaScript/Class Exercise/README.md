   When an input gets focused, its background color turns yellow.  
   When an input gets blurred, its background color returns to be white.

5. Create a webpage with a 4X5 table.  
   When a table cell hovered, change its background color.  
   When the mouse pointer leaves the cell, return the background color to be white.

6. Create a webpage with a form that contains two inputs for emails and a submit button.  
   When the button is clicked, the data is sent to `orders.html` page.  
   But, the data must be validated using JavaScript first:

- the first email must not be empty.
- the second email must not be empty.
- the first email must be equal to the second email.  
  If the form does not pass the validation:  
  display error message using "alert", mark the input in red, and do not send the data to `orders.html` page.
