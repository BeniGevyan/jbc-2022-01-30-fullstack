# Homework

## Create JavaScript for the following tasks:

### A. Objects

1. Create an object that describes a rectangle.  
   The object has the following properties: `width`, `height`, `x` position, and `y` position.  
   Set the properties with "Hard-Coded" values.  
   Display the properties using a "for" loop.
   Display the properties using a "for-in" loop.

2. Create an object that describes a smartphone.  
   The object has the following properties: `maker`, `model`, `color`, `price`.  
   Set the properties with "Hard-Coded" values.  
   Display the properties using a "for" loop.
   Display the properties using a "for-in" loop.
   Set the properties with values you get from the user.
   Display the properties again using a "for" loop.
   Display the properties again using a "for-in" loop.

3. Create an object that describes a customer.  
   The object has the following properties: `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phoneNumber`, `creditCard`.  
   `creditCard` is an object that has: `type` (Visa, Mastercard...), `number`, `expiration`, `CVV`.  
   Display all properties, including the credit card properties, using a "for" loop.
   Display all properties, including the credit card properties, using a "for-in" loop.

### B. Arrays

1. Create an array.  
   Fill the array with 5 vegetable names.  
   Display only the first one and the last one.
   Display all vegetables, each one on a separate line.  
   Display all vegetables in reverse order (last to first).

2. Create an array.  
   Fill the array with 10 grades you get from the user.  
   After filling the array, display whether all grades in the array are legal (between `0` to `100`).  
   If not all are legal, display the illegal grades.

3. Create an array.  
   Fill the array with 100 random integer numbers between `1` and `100` (inclusive).  
   Display:

- all the numbers separated with `|`.
- all the numbers in reverse order (last to first).
- the sum of all numbers.
- the average.
- the maximum.
- the minimum.
- the maximum number position (index).
- the minimum number position (index).
- how many numbers are above average.
- how many numbers are below average.
- how many numbers equal the average.
- all odd numbers.
- all even numbers.
- how many numbers are even.
- how many numbers end with `7` or can be divided by `7` without a reminder.
- the average of the even numbers.

4. **challenge** - Create an array.  
   Fill the array with 3 objects that describe products.  
   A product has the following properties: `name`, `code`, `price`, and `stock`.  
   Set all products properties with "Hard-Coded" values.
   Using "for" loop, display all products without using an internal loop.  
   Using "for" loop, display all products using an internal "for-in" loop.
