# Homework

## Write **TypeScript** for the following tasks

1. Create a hard-coded object of customer.  
   Customer object have first name, last name, age, and address properties.  
   Display the customer on the webpage.  
   Assign another hard-coded customer object to the first object you created.  
   Display the customer on the webpage again.  
   Try to assign a new object to the customer object, this time with the wrong properties and wrong types.  
   Note the TypeScript errors you get.

2. Create a function that gets two numbers as arguments `min` and `max`.  
   The function should return a random integer number between `min` and `max` (inclusive).  
   Create another function that gets a number `size` as an argument.  
   The function should return an array of the size `size` full of random numbers between `100` and `200` (use the first function).  
   Create another function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
   The function should display the array on the webpage.  
   Get a number `n` from the user (with prompt), and use the functions to display an array of the size `n` full of random numbers.

3. Create an Enum `Color` that describes 5 color options.
   Create a function named `printColorItem` that gets a `Color` Enum as an argument.  
   The function should use Switch-Case and display an item with the same color as `Color`.  
   For example, for `Color.Green`, you can display "Grass", for `Color.White`, you can display "Snow"..., etc.
