# Homework

## Create Flow Charts for the following:

### A. Conditions

1. Get two numbers from the user.  
Display the greater one.  
If they are equal, display one of them doesn't matter which one. 

2. Get a grade from the user.  
Display `Passed` if the grade is greater than or even to `60`,  
else, display `Failed`.

3. Get age from the user.  
Display a message that says if it is allowed to get a driving license at this age,  
else, display the number of years to wait until this is allowed.

4. Get a number from the user.  
Display `positive`, `negative` or `zero` - depending on what the number is.

5. Get a number from the user.  
Display one of the following - depending on what the number is:
* `The number is negative`
* `The number is zero`
* `The number is between 1 to 100 (inclusive)`
* `The number is between 101 to 1000 (inclusive)`
* `The number is greater than 1000`

6. Get a grade from the user.  
Display one of the following - depending on what the grade is:
* `Failed` if the grade is between `0` and `59` (inclusive)
* `Reasonable` if the grade is between `60` and `69` (inclusive)
* `Okay` if the grade is between `70` and `79` (inclusive)
* `Good` if the grade is between `80` and `89` (inclusive)
* `Excellent` if the grade is between `90` and `99` (inclusive)
* `Perfect` if the grade equals `100`

7. Get Three numbers from the user.  
Display the greatest among them.

### B. Loops

** All ranges are inclusive, for example, if the task is to display between `1` and `1000`, **include them!** as well.

1. Display all numbers between `1` and `1000` in **ascending** order.

2. Display all even numbers between `1` and `1000` in **ascending** order.

3. Display all odd numbers between `1` and `1000` in **ascending** order.

4. Display all numbers between `1` and `1000` in **descending** order.

5. Display all even numbers between `1` and `1000` in **descending** order.

6. Display all odd numbers between `1` and `1000` in **descending** order.

7. Get upper limit from the user.  
Display all the numbers between `1` to `upperLimit` that can be divided by `3` without leaving a remainder.

8. Get upper limit from the user.  
Display all the numbers between `1` to `upperLimit` in **ascending** order, then, in **descending** order.

9. Get two numbers from the user.  
Display all the numbers between the first number and the second number in **ascending** order,  
assume the first number is lower than the second number.  

10. Get two numbers from the user.  
Display all the numbers between the first number and the second number in **ascending** order,  
it is unknown which number is greater than the other.

11. Get three numbers from the user - `first`, `last`, and `num`.  
Display all the numbers between `first` and `last` that can be divided by `num` without leaving a remainder, in **ascending** order,  
assume the first number is lower than the second number. 

12. Get three numbers from the user - `first`, `last`, and `num`.  
Display all the numbers between `first` and `last` that can be divided by `num` without leaving a remainder, in **ascending** order,  
it is unknown which number is greater than the other.

13. Get numbers from the user again and again, until `0` is entered.  
For each number that the user enter (**including** `0`) - display if it can be divided by 7 without leaving a remainder or not.

14. Get numbers from the user again and again, until `0` is entered.  
For each number that the user enters (**not including** `0`) - display if it can be divided by 7 without leaving a remainder or not.

15. Get one hundred numbers from the user.  
Display their sum and average.

16. Get one hundred numbers from the user.  
Display the maximum number that was entered.

17. Get numbers from the user again and again, until `0` is entered.  
Display how many even numbers were entered.

18. **Challange** - get one number from the user.  
Display the sum of its digits, for example: for the number `8415` - display `18` (`8` + `4` + `1` + `5`).

19. **Challange** - get number `n` from the user again and again, until `0` is entered.  
For each number that the user enters, display all the numbers between `1` and `n`.  

20. **Challange** - get number `n` from the user.  
Display a square of `n`X`n` size full of Asterix (`*`).  
For example: `n` is `4`, then display:  
```
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
```  

21. **Challange** - get two numbers `hight` and `width` from the user.  
Display a rectangle of `hight`X`width` size full of Asterix (`*`).  
For example: `hight` is `4` and `width` is `8`, then display:  
```
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
```
