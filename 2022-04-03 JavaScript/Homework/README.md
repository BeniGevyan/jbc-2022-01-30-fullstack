# Homework

## Create JavaScript for the following tasks:

1. Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
   The function should return the average of the array.  
   Invoke this function three times with different "Hard-coded" arrays and display the result.

2. Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
   The function should return the minimum number in the array.  
   Invoke this function three times with different "Hard-coded" arrays and display the result.

3. Create a function that gets an array of strings as an argument.  
   The function should return the maximum length of a string in the array.  
   Invoke this function three times with different "Hard-coded" arrays and display the result.

4. Create a function that gets an array of strings as an argument.  
   The function should return the string with the maximum length in the array.  
   Invoke this function three times with different "Hard-coded" arrays and display the result.

5. Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
   The function should return how many numbers are greater or equal to the average of the array.  
   Invoke this function three times with different "Hard-coded" arrays and display the result.

6. Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
   The function should return the **index** of the maximum number in the array.  
   Invoke this function three times with different "Hard-coded" arrays and display the result.

7. Create a function that gets a matrix of numbers as an argument.  
   The function should return the maximum number in the matrix.  
   Invoke this function once with a "Hard-coded" matrix and display the result.

8. Create a function that gets a matrix of numbers as an argument.  
   The function should return the average of the matrix.  
   Invoke this function once with a "Hard-coded" matrix and display the result.

9. Create a function that gets one number as an argument.  
   The function should return `true` if the number is prime, and `false` otherwise.

10. Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
    The function should return `true` if every number in the array is prime, and `false` otherwise.  
    The function should use the previous function (form task 9.).

11. Create a function that gets two numbers as arguments, `min` and `max`.  
    The function should return a random integer number between `min` and `max` (inclusive).  
    Invoke this function three times with "Hard-coded" numbers and display the result.

12. **challenge** - Create a function that gets one number `n` as an argument.  
    The function should return an array with length `n` full of random integer numbers between `1` and `100` (inclusive).
    the function must use the functions you wrote on previous tasks.  
    Invoke this function three times with different "Hard-coded" numbers and display the result.
