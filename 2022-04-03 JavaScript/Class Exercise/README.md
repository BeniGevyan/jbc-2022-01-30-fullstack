# Class Exercise

## Create JavaScript for the following tasks:

1. Create a function that gets two numbers as arguments.  
   The function should return the maximum number between the two.  
   If the numbers are equal, return one of them.  
   Invoke this function once with "Hard-coded" arguments and display the result.

2. Create a function that gets three numbers as arguments.  
   The function should return the maximum number between the three.  
   If the numbers are equal, return one of them.  
   Invoke this function once with "Hard-coded" arguments and display the result.

3.

- Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
  The function should return the sum of numbers in the array.
- Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
  The function should return the average of the array by using the previous function.
- Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
  The function should return the maximum number in the array.  
  Invoke these functions with "Hard-coded" arguments and display the result.

4. Create a function that gets an array of numbers as an argument.  
   The function should return `true` if every number in the array is positive, else,  
   the function should return `false`.  
   Invoke this function once with a "Hard-coded" argument and display the result.
